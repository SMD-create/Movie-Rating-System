Ensemble Learning:

% It is a Machine Learning technique that combines the predictions of multiple individual models (called as base models or weak learners) to produce a more robust and accurate prediction than any other model.

% The idea behind Ensemble Learning is to reduce overfitting and to improve overall accuracy.

% There are several ensemble methods, namely
$Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating).
$Boosting
$Stacking

Bagging:

% It is an ensemble learning method that redues the variance offf  statistical learning method by constructing   multiple sets of training sets and sampling  them with replacement from the original data and constructing a model from each set.

% To create a bagged decision tree:-

$ Resample the training dataset with replacement
$ Train a decision tree on each bootstrap sample
$ Make predictions for each data point by averaging the predictions of all decision trees
