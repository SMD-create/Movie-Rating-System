									ML ASSIGNMENT-1

Applying the Find-S algorithm to the given table:

Initialize h to the most specific hypothesis in H:

h = <null, null, null, null, null, null>

For each positive training instance x:

For each attribute constraint a_i in h:

If the constraint a_i allows the value x_i:

do nothing

Else replace the constraint a_i in h by the next more general constraint that allows x_i

Output hypothesis h

Using this algorithm on the given table, the maximally specific hypothesis is:

h = <Round, Triangle, Round, Pink, Yes, Yes>

Yes, the Find-S algorithm has converged to the correct target concept. The hypothesis that it has found, i.e., <Round, Triangle, Round, Pink, Yes, Yes> is consistent with all the positive training examples in the table.

The most specific hypothesis is preferred because it generalizes poorly. In other words, it is more likely to overfit the training data, resulting in poor generalization to unseen data. Therefore, a more general hypothesis that still fits the training data is preferred.

Yes, the training examples in the given table are consistent with the maximally specific hypothesis that the Find-S algorithm has found.

If there are several maximally specific hypotheses, it means that these hypotheses are all consistent with the training data. In such a case, any of these hypotheses can be chosen as the output hypothesis. However, it is generally desirable to choose the simplest hypothesis, i.e., the one with the fewest attribute constraints. This is because simpler hypotheses are more likely to generalize well to new data.
