In the given paragraph, "immediate memory" typically refers to the CPU's cache memory, which is a small and fast memory that is located 
on the CPU chip itself. The cache memory stores frequently accessed data and instructions, which helps to speed up the CPU's operations.

On the other hand, "auxiliary memory" refers to secondary storage devices such as hard disk drives, solid-state drives, or external storage 
devices like USB drives. Auxiliary memory is used for long-term storage of programs and data, which can be accessed by the CPU as needed. 
Unlike the immediate memory, auxiliary memory has a larger capacity but is slower in accessing data.
